# election1976_2016

As someone who had never experienced an US presidential election *in the US* before, I spent most of my awake time listening to the news for the past four days. And after hearing repeatedly terms like swing states and blue wall states, two questions hit me: How "swining" are swing states? How blue are blue wall states?

Using MIT Election Data Lab and Charlie Smart's US cartogram map, I was able to get a clearer idea of the political landscape of each state for the past two decades.

As is shown on the map below, there are 11 little boxes inside each state-square, each of which represent the party that won the state in that election year. (Labels will show when mouse hover on a box)
