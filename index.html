        Did the political landscape change in each state for the past two
        decades?
      </h1>
      <p>
        All the media attention was on the swing states during the four-day
        vote-counting for the 2020 election. While waiting the election result
        and following news everyday, I became curious about the political
        leaning of each state, especially on two questions: How blue are
        blue-wall states? And how many times have swing states flipped?
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, with all the free time at my hands, I decided to make this map. I
        found Charlie Smart's
        <a href="https://github.com/charliesmart/d3-square-tile-map"
          >d3-square-tile-map</a
        >
        and based on his map, I filled each state square with 11 cubes -- each
        represents the winner of the presidential election year from 1976 to
        2016. (By the time of building this, whether Biden or Trump would win
        the election was not clear yet.)
